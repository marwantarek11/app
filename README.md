# Jenkins Deployment Automation for OpenShift

## Overview

This project automates the deployment process of applications to an OpenShift cluster using Jenkins. The deployment process involves building and pushing a Docker image to a container registry, then deploying the image to the OpenShift cluster using token credentials obtained from a service account. The Jenkins pipeline leverages a shared library for streamlined automation.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Jenkins Configuration

#### Description:
Ensure Jenkins is installed and configured on your system. Jenkins will serve as the automation engine for orchestrating the deployment process.

#### Steps:
1. Install Jenkins on your preferred environment (e.g., on-premises, cloud).
2. Configure Jenkins settings such as URL, security, and system preferences.
3. Install necessary plugins for Docker, OpenShift, and Jenkins Pipeline via the Jenkins Plugin Manager.

### 2. OpenShift Cluster Configuration

#### Description:
Set up an OpenShift cluster where the applications will be deployed. You'll need a functioning OpenShift environment and appropriate permissions to deploy applications.

#### Steps:
1. Set up an OpenShift cluster, either on-premises or using a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or GCP.
2. Ensure you have administrative access or sufficient permissions to manage projects and deploy applications.
3. Create a dedicated project or namespace for deploying your application.

### 3. Docker Image Build

#### Description:
Create a Dockerfile for your application to define the image build process. Jenkins will use this Dockerfile to build the Docker image, which will then be pushed to a container registry.

#### Steps:
1. Write a Dockerfile that describes the environment and dependencies required for your application.
2. Configure Jenkins to build the Docker image using the Docker plugin or Docker Pipeline.
3. Set up credentials in Jenkins to access the container registry where the Docker image will be pushed.

### 4. Jenkins Pipeline

#### Description:
Define a Jenkins Pipeline script to automate the deployment process. The pipeline will encompass stages for building the Docker image, pushing it to the container registry, and deploying it to the OpenShift cluster.

#### Steps:
1. Write a Jenkinsfile to define the stages and steps of the deployment pipeline.
2. Utilize a shared library for common deployment tasks to maintain consistency and reusability across pipelines.
3. Configure pipeline triggers and parameters as needed for manual or automated execution.

### 5. OpenShift Deployment

#### Description:
Configure the Jenkins Pipeline to deploy the Docker image to the OpenShift cluster. Jenkins will use token credentials obtained from a service account to authenticate the deployment.

#### Steps:
1. Create a service account in OpenShift with appropriate permissions for deployment.
2. Configure Jenkins to retrieve authentication token from the service account for accessing the OpenShift cluster.
3. Define deployment configurations in the Jenkins Pipeline script to deploy the Docker image to the desired project or namespace in OpenShift.

### 6. EC2 Worker Slave

#### Description:
Set up an EC2 instance to serve as a Jenkins worker slave for scalability and parallel execution. This EC2 instance will execute deployment tasks as part of the Jenkins Pipeline.

#### Steps:
1. Launch an EC2 instance in your preferred AWS region with the necessary configuration (e.g., instance type, AMI, security groups).
2. Install and configure the Jenkins agent software on the EC2 instance to enable it to connect to the Jenkins master.
3. Configure Jenkins to utilize the EC2 worker slave for deployment tasks, ensuring proper labeling and node configuration in the Jenkins Pipeline script.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, the deployment process can be initiated through the Jenkins Pipeline. Simply trigger the pipeline, and Jenkins will automatically execute the defined stages, building the Docker image, pushing it to the container registry, and deploying it to the OpenShift cluster using the specified configurations.
